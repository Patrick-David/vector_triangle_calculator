# vector_triangles

Function for calculating various metrics of a triangle,

from a 'vector' / 'linear algebra' point of view.


The calculations are deliberately inefficient as they serve to show the vector

form of the calculations (Dot Products, Law of Cosines etc) rather than outright

computational efficiency.
